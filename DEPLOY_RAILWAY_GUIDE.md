# 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

✅ **Files Ready for Railway:**
- `app_railway.py` - Production Flask app
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies  
- `Procfile` - Railway start command
- `railway.json` - Platform configuration
- `README_RAILWAY.md` - Documentation

✅ **Features Included:**
- Document upload and processing
- AI/ML defect detection
- Interactive dashboard
- Delete functionality with confirmation
- CSV export
- Health check endpoint
- Error handling and logging

## 🌐 Railway Deployment Steps

### Method 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Railway deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Railway:**
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Click "Start a New Project"
   - Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository
   - Railway auto-detects Flask app

3. **Deploy:**
   - Railway automatically builds and deploys
   - Your app will be live at: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

### Method 2: Railway CLI

1. **Install Railway CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login and Deploy:**
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

## 🔧 Post-Deployment

### Environment Variables (Optional)
- `SECRET_KEY` - Flask security (auto-generated if not set)
- `RAILWAY_STATIC_URL` - Static files URL (auto-configured)

### Test Your Deployment
1. Visit your Railway URL
2. Upload a test document (try `test_survey_for_delete.txt`)
3. Check dashboard at `/dashboard`
4. Test delete functionality
5. Verify health check at `/health`

## 📱 Using Your Deployed App

### Main Features:
- **Home**: Upload and analyze building inspection documents
- **Dashboard**: View analytics and manage analyses
- **Results**: Detailed defect analysis with confidence scores
- **Delete**: Remove old analyses (with confirmation)
- **Export**: Download CSV reports

### Supported Files:
- PDF building inspection reports
- DOCX survey documents  
- TXT plain text reports

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build Fails**: Check `requirements.txt` syntax
2. **App Won't Start**: Verify `Procfile` command
3. **Database Issues**: SQLite auto-initializes on first run
4. **File Upload Fails**: Check file size (50MB limit)

### Logs:
```bash
railway logs
```

### Health Check:
Visit `https://your-app.railway.app/health`

## 📊 Expected Performance

- **Cold Start**: ~10-15 seconds
- **File Processing**: 2-5 seconds per document
- **Memory Usage**: ~150-300MB
- **Storage**: SQLite database grows with usage
