BUILDING SURVEY REPORT
Property Address: 123 Main Street, Sample City
Survey Date: August 4, 2025
Inspector: John Smith, Chartered Surveyor

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This property inspection has identified several areas of concern that require attention.

STRUCTURAL ASSESSMENT
The foundation shows visible cracks along the east wall, measuring approximately 2mm wide and extending from ground level to the first floor. These cracks appear to be settlement-related and require monitoring.

The main support beams in the basement show signs of structural stress with minor deflection noted in the central span.

MOISTURE AND DAMP ISSUES
Significant damp was observed in the basement area with moisture buildup on the concrete walls. The humidity levels are elevated, creating conditions conducive to mold growth.

Water damage is evident around the kitchen window frame where condensation has caused deterioration of the surrounding plaster.

ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS
The electrical wiring in the main panel appears to be corroded, with several connections showing signs of oxidation. This poses a potential safety hazard and requires immediate attention from a qualified electrician.

Outlets in the bathroom area lack proper GFCI protection, which is a code violation.

PLUMBING ASSESSMENT
The main water pipe running through the basement shows signs of minor leakage at the joint connections. Water pressure throughout the house is below optimal levels.

The drainage system in the basement floor drain appears to have a blockage causing water to pool during heavy rainfall.

EXTERIOR CONDITIONS
Mold growth was detected on the north-facing exterior wall, likely due to poor ventilation and constant moisture exposure.

The roof tiles show signs of deterioration with several loose or cracked tiles that could allow water infiltration.

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Monitor foundation cracks for movement
2. Address moisture issues immediately
3. Replace corroded electrical components
4. Repair plumbing leaks
5. Professional mold remediation required
6. Roof maintenance needed

CONCLUSION
While the property is structurally sound, several maintenance issues require prompt attention to prevent further deterioration.
